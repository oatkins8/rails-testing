# in tests - seperate db
# seeds problem - they are slow
# fixtures - way to quickly insert data using a yml file
# yml very important in testing and devops - looks like json
# name of the yml file must match the table (e.g. products)
# seeds use active record (which slows it down)
# fixtures insert the data directly into the sql (faster)

# now when you run the tests ^ this data will be injected into the products table
# after inserting the data - we see the test catch the problem

# Failure:

# expected to find visible css "h1" with text "Awesome Products" but there were no matches. Also found "NoMethodError in Products#index", which matched the selector but not all filters.
